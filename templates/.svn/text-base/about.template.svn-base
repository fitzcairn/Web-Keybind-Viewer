            <p>Welcome to Fitzcairn's Keybind Viewer!  This tool works
            with the <a
            href="http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/keybindviewer.aspx">KeybindViewer
            addon for World of Warcraft</a> to give you a visual
            online display of your keybinds.  A step-by-step guide for
            using the Keybind Viewer is below.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Install the KeybindViewer WoW addon</h3>

            <p>KeybindViewer is available from <a
            href="http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/keybindviewer.aspx">Curse</a>
            or <a
            href="http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info19231-KeybindViewer.html">WowInterface</a>.
            Follow the directions on your download site of choice for
            installation.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Log in, and open KeybindViewer.</h3>

            <p>Make sure KeyindViewer is enabled at your character
            screen.  Once you're in the game, you can type /kbv, or
            click the minimap icon.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: Copy and paste the link in the upper right of
            KeybindViewer into the address bar of your
            webbrowser.</h3>

            <p>That's it, you're done!  This link can be safely
            bookmarked, shared with friends, or posted in forums--it
            won't change.</p>

            <p>I've been trying to give back to the community for a
            while now, and have the following tools available:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li><b><a href="http://macroexplain.com">Fitzcairn's Macro
              Explain-o-Matic</a></b>: an online tool for explaining what
              your macro does.  In addition, it allows the saving of
              macros for sharing with friends, macro rating, and
              searching for macros.</li>
              <br>
              <li><b>KeybindTrainer (<a href="http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/keybindtrainer.aspx">Curse</a>, <a
              href="http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=18769#info">WowInterface</a>)</b>: a WoW addon for training
              yourself on your keybinds.  Tests you on your binds, and
              allows for the creation and sharing of custom tests for
              specific key sequences.

            <p>I've been playing World of Warcraft on and off for
            several years, culminating in running a large and
            successful guild on US Moon Guard realm. I've since
            retired to just casual play among friends.  These days I'm
            an avid (and terrible) PvPer who prefers stabbing stuff on
            my Rogue (Fitzcairn).</p>
