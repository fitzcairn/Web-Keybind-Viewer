Web-Keybind-Viewer
==================

This is the source code for a web front-end intended to quickly render keybind layouts for the KeybindViewer addon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/keybindviewer).  It is a Google App Engine app.

As currently released, this app is functional but incomplete.  There are a lot of TODOs remaining.  I am releasing it here in case someone finds the keyboard layout rendering code useful--that was by far the most interesting code to write.
